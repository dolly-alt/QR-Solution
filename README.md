## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Finally figured out how to do flexbox. This is week 2 of me learning HTML/CSS and I was frustrated when I tried this the first time. I am still a bit unsure about the properties used but I was able to get it to look similar to the file.

### Continued development

I need to learn more CSS properties and their best use cases. For example, I originally specified both the width and height of the container but was able to get the look with just one line using the max-width property.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - Was a godsend to figure out properties and how to align items in flexbox
- [Brad Traversy](https://www.youtube.com/@TraversyMedia) - His Flexbox crash course was really helpful. Definitely recommend any of his videos.
